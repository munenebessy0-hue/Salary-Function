The tasks include:
- Importing salary data
- Creating functions to retrieve employee details
- Processing data with dictionaries
- Implementing error handling
- Exporting employee details to CSV and zipping the file
- Using R to unzip and display the data

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`salary_data.ipynb`).
2. Run all Python cells to:
   - Import data
   - Process employee details
   - Export to CSV and ZIP
3. Switch to the R cell (requires R kernel in Jupyter or RStudio).
4. Run the R code to unzip and display employee data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- R (with `utils` package)

## Output
- Zipped folder: `Employee Profile.zip`
- Extracted employee CSV file.
